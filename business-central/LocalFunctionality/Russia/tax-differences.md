# Tax differences

Tax differences are variations in tax amounts caused by the different rules for recognizing income and expenses between entries for book accounting and tax accounting.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up tax difference registers and tax difference journals to track and manage differences between book accounting and tax accounting amounts.

## Preparing the chart of accounts

Before you set up tax differences, you'll have to make sure that your chart of accounts is set up to correctly handle tax accounting and tax differences. At a minimum, your chart of accounts must contain tax difference accounts for income and expense transactions.

## Getting started with tax differences

To set up and view tax difference entries, you'll use the following tables, which support tax differences windows.
