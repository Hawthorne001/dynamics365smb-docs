# Sales Decomposition (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Sales Decomposition** report provides a detailed analysis of sales metrics, breaking them down into their key contributing components. This report empowers users to understand what is driving changes in sales performance and why.

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to identify trends, break down sales metrics into their key contributing components, and make informed adjustments to strategies.

As the CEO of a furniture company, the report enables you to assess high-level sales trends and identify key drivers behind performance fluctuations. For example, you notice that sales of office desks are driving significant growth in the south-east region. The decomposition tree reveals that 30% of this growth is attributed to new customers acquired in the past quarter. Based on this insight, you decide to invest in expanding marketing campaigns targeting buyers in other regions.

As the regional sales manager, the report helps you  monitor individual location contributions and optimize regional sales strategies. Using the report, you spot that the west location has seen a 15% drop in sales, primarily due to a decline in sales of classic desks. In response, you assign a dedicated salesperson to the west coast to focus on re-engaging client and offer special discounts.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**
