## <a name="permissions"></a>SmartLists and permissions

By default, only users that have SUPER permissions can create and preview SmartList queries. You can grant permission to other users to create and preview SmartList queries by assigning them the *SmartList Designer* permission set, or adding users or user groups to the *SmartList Designer* permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

<!--Permissions to create and preview SmartList queries are two separate permissions. To create a SmartList query, the user must have permissions to system object 9600. To preview a SmartList query, the user must have permissions to system object 9500.-->

<!--### Permission to preview SmartLists

Permissions will need to be granted to any user that should have the ability to preview the results of a SmartList query definition. To grant this permission, navigate to permission sets, select the SmartList Designer permission set, and add permissions to system object 9605.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By granting this permission, you are granting the user the right to preview any data results from the SmartList query being defined. The user must still have permissions to the tables defined in the query in order to see data.

### SmartList query permissions

Users will need to be granted permissions to each SmartList query created for them to view the SmartList query. To do this, navigate to permission sets, create a new permission set, add permissions to the permission set and then add users or user groups to the permission set.  

To add permissions to the user defined permission set, select **Permissions** once the user-defined permission set is created. From the **Permissions** page, select **SmartList Permissions** from the actions at the top. The action may be hidden under the (â€¦) option.  

Add the desired SmartList queries to the user-defined permission set. Permissions can also be added from the **SmartList Management** page however, the user-defined permission set must exist to use that functionality.
