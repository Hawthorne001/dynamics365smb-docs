# Display lists in different ways

List pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] let you choose how to display the records. A list can display as detailed rows, which is ideal when you need to work with many fields or edit fields in the list. But, you can also switch to display records as tiles, which is more compact and shows fewer fields on the specific record. Tiles are useful for an overview of several entries and are helpful on smaller devices because they're compact and easier to tap.

## Items list

On the **Items** page, having pictures helps you get a quick overview of what you sell and switching to the tiles gives you an item catalog to browse through. For lists that include pictures, such as the **Items** page, you have a third option to display as large tiles. This displays large pictures for each record but also shows few fields.

You can import item pictures, either one by one or for multiple items in one go. Learn more in [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).
