# Setup Best Practices: Global Planning Setup

The **Planning** FastTab on the **Inventory Setup** page contains several fields that define global rules for supply planning.  

The following table provides best practices on how to set up selected global planning parameter fields.  

| Setup field | Best practice |
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Use Forecast on Locations|Select if you have forecasts for specific locations.|
|Use Forecast on Variants| Select if you have items with variants and want to specify forecast for each variant individually|
|Blank Overflow Level|Use only if you want to allow all or some of your items to overflow the reorder point.|
|Default Dampener Period|Set between 1D and 5D.<br/><br/> If you're new to planning in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set a longer period. When you're more familiar with the different reasons for action messages, shorten the dampener period to allow more change suggestions.|  
|Default Dampener Quantity %|Set between 5 and 20 percent of the itemâ€™s lot size.|

The **Planning** FastTab on the **Manufacturing Setup** page also contains several fields that define global rules for supply planning.  

The following table provides best practices on how to set up selected global planning parameter fields.

|Setup field|Best practice|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Components at Location|If items aren't defined as SKUs, select the location code of your main warehouse. This selection also applies if you only use the requisition worksheet.|
