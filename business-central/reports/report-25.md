# Financial Report (report)

The **Financial Report** report shows general ledger (G/L) transactions in a given period, grouped by a setup (a report definition) you defined for rows and columns in the Financial Reporting feature.

## Learn more about the Financial Reporting feature

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries.
