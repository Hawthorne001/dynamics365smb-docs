By default, the general journal only shows a limited number of fields on the journal line. If you want to show more fields, such as the **Account Type** field, choose the **Show More Columns** action. To hide the additional fields again, choose the **Show Fewer Columns** action. When you show fewer columns, the same posting date is used for all lines. If you want to have multiple posting dates for the same journal entry, choose the **Show More Columns** action.

To save space on the page, when you apply one of these actions, the name of the applied action is hidden. For example, if the **Show More Columns** action is available, the **Show Fewer Columns** action isn't.
