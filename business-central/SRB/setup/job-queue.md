For subscription billing, you can create the following entry in the job queue:

* **Update Sub. Lines Term. Dates** (codeunit 8058): Automatically updates date fields in subscription lines. To learn more, go to [Termination of contract components](../working-with-contracts/service-commitment-cancellation.md).
