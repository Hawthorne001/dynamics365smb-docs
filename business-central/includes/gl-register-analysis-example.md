To get an overview of the types of transactions that happened to your general ledger and the types of sources for them, do as follows:

1. Open the [G/L Registers](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=116&layout=analysis) list and choose :::image type="content" source="../media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Source code** field to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **GL entries by source**, or something that describes this analysis.

> [!TIP]
> You can perform this analysis during or after go-live of your environment to understand which types of transactions are used and which types are not yet being used.


The following image shows the result of these steps.
