# VAT return in the Czech version

The VAT return feature in Business Central enabled generate and submit the VAT return to the “Moje daně” portal. The lines on the VAT return are created based on the settings in the VAT statement. The system verifies if a regular VAT return has already been created for the period. However, since there can be multiple corrective and additional returns for a given period, this is not checked. This feature allows the VAT return to be saved, providing the user with immediate access to it in the system for future reference.
