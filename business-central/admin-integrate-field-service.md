# Integrate with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service

Service organizations require a front-to-back application in which finance, inventory, and procurement are tightly coupled with service delivery. They generate financial data with every transaction. Every work order represents cost and revenue, and every resource generates profit and loss. Customer interactions add entries on the general ledger. The integration between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] streamlines the end-to-end process of managing service operations and ensures a smooth flow of information between the two systems.  

You can easily create and manage work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], track the progress of service tasks, assign resources, and capture consumption details. When you complete a work order in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], the integration enables the smooth transfer of data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for further processing.  

The integration also facilitates the invoicing and fulfillment of work orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can generate accurate invoices based on the service activities and the consumption recorded in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  

By integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], you don't have to enter data manually or duplicate efforts. Integration also provides a comprehensive view of service operations and finances, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] is built on top of Dynamics 365 Sales, you must [set up a connection to Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#to-use-the-dataverse-connection-setup-assisted-setup-guide) and [enable integration to Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration#connection-settings-in-the-setup-guide).

You must download the following apps from AppSource, and install them in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment:

- [Field Service Integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917)
- [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2304910)

> [!NOTE]
> The Business Central Virtual Table app is optional. It's required only if you want to view information about item availability from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To learn more, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Permissions and security roles for user accounts

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions change, you might need to reset them. To do that, reinstall the Integration Solution from the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution**. The following sections list the permissions and security roles that the solution deploys for each app.

#### Sales

- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Administrator
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration User
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Product Availability User

#### Business Central

Users who post project journals must have the following permission set:

- Dynamics 365 Sales Integration

#### Field Service

To use the integrated data, users must have the following security role:

- Business Central Field Service Integration

For example, users must have this role to connect work orders to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that users are assigned to the standard security roles and profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  
>
> To learn more about column security profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], go to [Field Service security roles](/dynamics365/field-service/users-licenses-permissions#field-service-security-roles).
>
> Administrators must add one of the appropriate column security profiles to users in Power Platform. To learn more, go to [Add teams or users to a column security profile to control access](/power-platform/admin/add-teams-users-field-security-profile).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> - You must have **Read** permissions for the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_connection) table.
> - You must have **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** permissions for the **Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Other settings in Field Service

On the **Field Service Setting** page, make the following changes:

- On the **Purchase** tab, clear the **Use of Products Out of Stock** field. Otherwise, you might get an "out of stock" warning when you choose a product that's out of stock in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], but is in stock in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- On the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn off the **Calculate Price** and **Calculate Cost** toggles. In the **Work Order Invoice Creation** field, choose **Never**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up a connection to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] removes the coupling between resources and products. To make [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] items available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], update the **Field Service Product Type** field to match the **Type** field on the items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a product or service](/dynamics365/field-service/create-product-or-service#create-a-product-or-service).

## Set up the integration in Business Central

After you have a connection to Dataverse and Sales, you can set up your integration to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

1. Download and install the **Field Service Integration** app from [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917). Afterward, on the **Extension Management** page, find the Field Service Integration app, and choose the **Set up** action to run the assisted setup guide.
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** to run the assisted setup guide.

This section describes the key settings in the guide.

Optionally, if you want to enable technicians to view information about item availability from work orders, choose the **Install Business Central Virtual Table app** link.

To let people post consumption of items and services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders, specify the **Project Journal Template** and **Project Journal Batch** to use to post consumption of products and services.

Because services are expressed in duration in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], specify the **Hours Unit of Measure** to use to convert durations to quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can also specify when work order products and service lines synchronize to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, they might synchronize when work order lines are used, or when someone completes a work order. Choose the appropriate option in the **Synchronize work order products/services** field.

After work order products and services synchronize to project journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose whether to post the project journals manually. Choose the appropriate option in the **Automatically post project journals lines** field:

- When a work order is complete.
- When work order products or services are used.

After you finish the setup, run a full synchronization from the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page. This action synchronizes table mappings for things like:

- Project tasks for projects with the **Apply Usage Link** set. This synchronization makes [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] projects available for selection in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Resources that aren't blocked, don't have **Use Time Sheet** selected, and do have **Hours** specified as the unit of measure on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
- Service items (requires that you're using the Premium experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]).

## Standard Field Service entity mapping for synchronization

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in Dataverse, so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables. To learn more about table mappings, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization).

Integration with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] introduces the following standard integration table mappings:

- **PJLINE-WORDERPRODUCT** - Maps work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- **PJLINE-WORDERSERVICE** - Maps work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- **PROJECTTASK** - Maps projects and project tasks in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to products in external projects in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- **RESOURCE-BOOKABLERSC** - Maps resources in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to bookable resources in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- **SVCITEM-CUSTASSET** - (Premium Experience only) Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- **LOCATIONS** - Maps locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The **LOCATIONS** integration table mapping is available only if the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page is turned on.

### Additional synchronization of locations and warehouses

You can integrate [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] warehouses with locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration gives technicians information about the availability of a product or item at a specific location.

The data synchronizes through a unidirectional (from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) integration table mapping between locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To use the integration table mapping, in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you must turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes locations with the following settings on the **Location Card** page:

- The **Use as In-Transit** toggle is turned off.
- **Project Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)
- **Assm. Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Locations** and **Location Card** page, you can use the **Warehouse** action to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs.

### View item availability in Business Central from Field Service

When technicians prepare work orders, it's helpful that they can be sure that the items they need to do the work are available. This section describes how to let people view item availability information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

The first thing to do is to install the [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917) app from AppSource.

Afterward, on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** or **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** toggle. When you enable inventory availability by location, a **dyn365bc_availabilitybylocation_v2_0** virtual table becomes available. You must create a synthetic relation between the following tables:

- The native **Product** and **Work Order Product** tables in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and the **Item Availability** virtual table that shows item availability.

There's an assisted setup guide to help you create the synthetic relation.

To create the synthetic relation, follow these steps:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, use the **Synthetic Relations** action
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **CRM Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide again.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **FS Work Order Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. Choose **Next**.
1. In the **Field in the FS Work Order Product table** field, choose **Product Id**.
1. In the **Field in the Item Availability by Location table** field, choose **itemNo**.
1. Choose **Finish** to complete the guide.
1. To make your setup available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], in the **Power Apps admin center**, choose the view, and then choose the **Save and Publish** action.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few moments to create the synthetic relations.

To learn more about virtual tables and synthetic relationships, go to [Use virtual tables to get more data](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#use-virtual-tables-to-get-more-data).  

The next thing to do is to create and customize the associated view that people use in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to check the inventory of products.

To create the view, follow these steps:

1. In **Power Apps admin center**, on the navigation pane, choose **Tables**.
1. Choose the **Item Availability by Location** table.
1. In the **Data experiences** part, choose **Views**.
1. Choose the **View column** action, and then choose the columns you want the view to include. The following columns are typical choices:

    - **Location Code** shows where the product is available.
    - **Item No.** confirms you're looking at the correct product.
    - **Item Description** provides information about the product.
    - **Unit of Measure Code** gives you an idea of the space you'll need.
    - **Remaining Quantity** shows how much of the product is available at each location.

## Use data in both applications

The following sections describe the features where you can use the data that comes from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Field Service

You can [create work orders](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order) using the **Service Account** and **Billing Account** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On work orders, you must select the **Business Central Project Task** in the **External Project** field. Selecting a project lets you synchronize work order products and services to the appropriate project task in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can add inventory and noninventory items as **Work Order Products** on work orders and get the quantity on hand and costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a work order from the work order form and record list](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order#create-a-work-order-from-the-work-order-form-and-record-list).

You can add items of the type service as **Work Order Services**, and get costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Products and services tab](/dynamics365/field-service/work-order-experience#products-and-services-tab).

> [!NOTE]
> When a product or service's status on a work order changes from **Estimated** to **Used** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], they'll synchronize to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can book a resource and relate the **Bookings** to work order services using a **Bookable Resource** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can use **Open in Business Central** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to open a location in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that's coupled to a warehouse in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

Use the **Open in Business Central** action to open a location in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that's coupled to a warehouse in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. On the **Products** page, technicians can check how much of particular product is available at a warehouse they specify.

From the **Work Order** and **Product** pages, you can view where, and how much, of an item is available. On the **Related** menu, choose **Items Availability by Location**.

### Business Central

Depending on your settings on the **Field Service Integration Setup** page, when work orders include products and services, consumption information is transferred and posted using a **Project Journal** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Quantity To Bill** and **Duration To Bill** values are copied to the **Qty- to Transfer to Invoice** field. Based on those values, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to invoice the customer. After the invoice is posted and synchronized to the Dynamics 365 Sales environment, or consumption is processed in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantity invoiced and quantity consumed display on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab on the **Work Order Product** and **Work Order Service** pages.  

Use the **Project Planning Lines** page to track posting and invoicing of consumption on work orders. From the **Project Planning Lines** page, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize them with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and keep track of the status of the invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> Work order services with a booking that uses a bookable resource that's coupled to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resource synchronize to two project journal lines: one line of type **Budget** for the coupled resource, and another line of type **Billable** for the item being serviced.
>
> The product that's chosen on the work order service must be coupled to an item of the type **Service** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also, the base unit of measure for the item must be set to the **Hours Unit of Measure** that's chosen on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
>
> You can create an invoice for an item of the type **Service** from the billable project planning line, and use the budget project planning line to register cost with the resource.

Use the **Locations in Field Service** action on the **Locations** and **Location Card** pages to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs. You can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in Business Central's inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically become an input for planning.
