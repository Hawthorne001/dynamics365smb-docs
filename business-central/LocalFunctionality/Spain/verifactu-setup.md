# VERI*FACTU rules in Spain

VERI*FACTU is a regulatory framework introduced by the Spanish government to modernize and secure electronic invoicing systems. Its primary goal is to combat tax fraud and enhance transparency in business transactions. The framework is governed by Royal Decree 1007/2023, later amended by Royal Decree 254/2025, and forms part of Spain’s broader Anti-Fraud Law 11/2021.

VERI*FACTU refers to a "verifiable invoicing system"—a type of computerized invoicing system (SIF) that can optionally send invoice records in real time to the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT).  

Businesses in Spain have the option to use the [SII](sii-setup.md), in which case VERI*FACTU (SIF) rules don't apply to them. [SII](sii-setup.md) can be enforced for large companies with an annual turnover exceeding the threshold, but businesses may also opt in voluntarily to report SII. In all other cases, SIF is mandatory.

## Set up VERI*FACTU

Dynamics 365 Business Central supports VERI*FACTU frameworks using integration with the B2Brouter API through our default connector. To set up this mode, follow these steps:

### Disable SII module

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SII Setup**, and then select the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, be sure the **Enabled** field isn't selected.  

Learn more in [SII setup](sii-setup.md), which provides more information about how to set up the SII.

### Enable B2BRouter connector

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
1. Choose the **Install E-Documents integration from AppSource** action to open the **Microsoft AppSource apps** page.  
1. Choose the **B2BRouter** connector, and then select the **View on AppSource** action.  
1. Install the app from the AppSource.
1. On the **E-Document Service** page, change the **Service Integration** to **B2BRouter**.  
1. On the **E-Document Service** page, select the **Setup Service Integration** action.
1. On the **B2BRouter Connection Setup** page, enter the **API-KEY** to specify the key you'll use for your B2BRouter environment and the **ProjectID** field to specify the project name for the B2BRouter environment.
1. If you want to use this connector in sandbox mode, select the **Staging Mode** field.
1. Continue with the [nonservice provider setup steps](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).
