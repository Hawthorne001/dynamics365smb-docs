title: Electronic Invoicing FAQ
summary: |
  Microsoft supports electronic invoicing in Business Central through the E-Document app, a standardized framework available across all localizations. In addition, users can install specific connectors to integrate with external e-invoicing exchange services. Country-specific requirements are delivered through dedicated E-Document localizations tailored for each supported market.   
  
  This FAQ answers some of the key questions about electronic invoicing.
