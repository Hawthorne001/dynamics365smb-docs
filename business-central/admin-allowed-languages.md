# Specify the languages that are available in your Business Central environment

To let people work in their preferred language, the user interface (UI) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is translated by apps that Microsoft provides, or by language apps that our partners provide on AppSource. Administrators install the language apps in their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Afterward, on the **My Settings** page, people can choose the language in which they want to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Languages** page lists all languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports. However, to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a selected language, the language app must be installed in the environment. If someone chooses a language that a language app isn't installed for, they might be confused when the UI doesn't change.

To avoid confusion and make it easier for people to select a language they can use, administrators can use the **Allowed Languages** page to define the languages that people can choose from on the **My Settings** page.
