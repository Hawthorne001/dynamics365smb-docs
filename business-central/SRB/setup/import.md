# Import contracts and contract lines

Before you can set up contracts and contract lines, you must create some data, or import it from another system. In addition to customers, vendors, and items, you must create subscription packages, subscription package lines, and more. You use configuration packages to import data. The data for customer subscription contracts, contract lines, subscriptions, and subscription lines imports to tables created specifically for processing the data.

## Import master data

To import customers, items, subscription lines, vendor subscription contracts, and so on, create [Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages).

|Name|Table|
|:--|:--|
|Items|27|
|Subscription Package Line Templates|70920754|
|Subscription Packages|70920755|
|Subscription Package Lines|70920756|
|Item Subscription Packages|70920758|
|Vendor  Contract|70920763|

## Import customer subscription contracts, subscription contract lines, subscriptions, and subscription lines

There are particular import tables for importing customer subscription contracts, contract lines, subscriptions, and subscription lines. After the import, you can view, edit, and use the data to create corresponding records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Imported Customer Subscription Contracts**, **Imported Subscriptions**, and **Imported Subscription Lines** pages. Use the following tables to import and create subscriptions, subscription lines, and contract lines.

|Name|Table|
|:--|:--|
|Imported Customer Subscription Contracts|70920710|
|Imported Subscriptions|70920708|
|Imported Subscription Lines|70920709|
