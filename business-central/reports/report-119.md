# Customer - Sales list (report)

The **Customer - Sales list** report shows customer sales for a period. You can choose to include only customers with total sales that exceed a minimum amount. You can also specify whether you want the report to show address details for each customer.

The report is based on recorded sales in the local currency (LCY) from customer ledger entries. The total reported sales are in LCY. The total is based on the customers that you include in the report. In other words, it's based on the customers that: 

* Are within the filters on the **Customer** FastTab.
* Have total sales that exceed the amount specified in the **Amounts (LCY) Greater Than** field on the **Options** FastTab.

> [!TIP]
> When you specify the period for the report, you use a date filter. To learn about entering date filters, go to [Period](../ui-enter-date-ranges.md#period).
