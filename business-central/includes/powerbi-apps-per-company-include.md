The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](powerbi-name.md)] apps currently work per company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. If you have multiple companies in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] environment, you must install and set up a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](powerbi-name.md)] template app for each company. Each app is then available in its own [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](powerbi-name.md)] workspace.
