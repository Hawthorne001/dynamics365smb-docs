# Collecting profit tax information for tax declaration

To reduce the labor required to complete a profit tax declaration and to simplify the company bookkeeping, the reporting document is split into supplements in accordance with the source. For each supplement, which is filled in by a taxpayer, a synthetic tax register is created in the tax accounting module, where all the declaration lines are stated and data sources and creation rules for each line are described.

In the tax accounting module, the following synthetic registers of the Profit Tax Declaration Reporting document are realized:

- Sheet 02 Profit Tax Calculation
- Supplement 1 to Sheet 02. Sales Income
- Supplement 2 to Sheet 02. Production and Sales Costs
- Supplement 3 to Sheet 02. Special Production and Sales Costs
- Supplement 4 to Sheet 02. Calculation of Loss Amount or Loss Amount Part decreasing the taxation basis
- Supplement 6 to Sheet 02. Non – Sales Costs
- Supplement 7 to Sheet 02. Non – Sales Costs and Losses to be understood as non–sale
