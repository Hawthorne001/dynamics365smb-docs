# Summarize records with Copilot

Use Copilot to get a quick summary of a record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, directly in the page's FactBox pane. The summary includes two or three concise bullet points that provide details and insights about the data. The summary helps you understand the data and identify areas that need attention. You can interact with the summary to link to data sources and open related pages, so you can act on your data.



## Prerequisites

The **Summarize** capability is active, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md)

## How to use the Summarize

Open a record, and Copilot generates a summary in the **Summary** section at the top of the FactBox pane on the right side.





- Ask for more insights

  If you want more information, select the **More insights** button in the FactBox. The Chat with Copilot pane opens to display more points of interest. You can ask follow-up questions to learn how to use Business Central to take action based on those insights.

  Some summary text is linked, so you can preview or navigate to the data source. Select the links to view details or take action based on the summarized data.

- Regenerate the summary
