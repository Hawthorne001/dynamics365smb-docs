To generate a report about depreciation, acquisitions, and disposals for a selected period, and the book value at the end of the period, use the following reports:

- Book Value 01
- Book Value 02

The reports include similar information. However, the **Book Value 01** report displays one line for each asset and must be printed in landscape orientation.

The **Book Value 02** report displays the information on several lines for each asset.
