# Set up service offerings

When you set up service management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item that needs servicing, for example, the computer that needs repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.
