In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create delivery reminders when a purchase is delivered as expected. You can generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries, or you can create a single delivery reminder manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> To create delivery reminders, you must set up the delivery reminder terms, levels, and texts.  

## Generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Delivery Reminder** page, choose the **Create Delivery Reminder** action.  
1. Select the appropriate filters.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

If there are overdue deliveries that match the filters that you set, delivery reminders are created. You can now issue and print the delivery reminders.
