## What data does Microsoft collect and how is it used?

The [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) applies to Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] and other Microsoft products and services. The information below provides additional transparency about what data is collected and how it is used when you access Microsoft’s Copilot and agent features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)].

- **Diagnostic data**: All prompts (inputs) and responses (outputs) are stored securely in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] for a period of 20 days to facilitate responding to support requests. This diagnostic data is stored alongside your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] company data within the same geographic and compliance boundary. The data doesn't count against database quotas. Prompts and responses might include company data and personal data. The data can only be accessed by Microsoft personnel as part of a customer support request. Organizations implementing Customer Lockbox policies will receive a data access request for their approval before Microsoft can access this data as part of a support request. Learn more about lockbox in [Business Central security](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-online#customer-lockbox).

  Microsoft doesn't use your company data, prompts, or responses to train AI models. For more information, see Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features.

- **Usage data**: Microsoft collects the minimum data required to operate and improve the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] service, including anonymized data about your use of AI. Usage data doesn't include prompts (inputs) or responses (outputs), and it doesn't include customer data or personal data.

- **Feedback**: Microsoft collects feedback that users provide using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons in the UI. When you give feedback, we record whether you liked or disliked something, the reason for a dislike (if you share one), and which AI feature your feedback is about.

  We don't automatically collect your prompt (input), or the AI response (output) when you give feedback.
