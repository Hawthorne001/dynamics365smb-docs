# Compliance with the Spanish regulations 

In accordance with Spanish regulations—specifically Article 13 of Royal Decree 1007/2023, of December 5, which establishes the requirements for billing systems, and Article 15 of Ministerial Order HAC/1177/2024, of October 17, which defines the technical specifications for such systems—software providers are required to issue a self-responsible declaration to confirm compliance with these obligations.
