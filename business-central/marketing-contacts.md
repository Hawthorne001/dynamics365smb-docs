# Manage contacts

Employees in your company regularly meet prospective business relations that might develop into formal relationships. You can record details about external contacts so that communication is more successful, and so it's easier to convert them to formal customer, vendor, or bank relationships.

Use the **Contacts** list to manage your contacts. From there, you can create opportunities and manage other interactions with individual contacts. You can also see statistics about a contact, and you can access a range of reports. Learn more at [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.
