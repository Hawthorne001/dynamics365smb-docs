# Planned subscription lines in subscriptions

On the **Planned Subscription Lines** page, subscription lines describe the monetary content of agreements with customers and suppliers as well as termination dates. In order for a subscription line to be billed recurrently, it must be assigned to a contract.

A subscription line is valid if the **Invoicing via** field is set to **Contract** and the **Service End Date** field is either blank or the date in the **Next Billing Date** field hasn't reached the date in the **Service End Date**. Subscription lines with invoicing via sales are used to store information and aren't billed on a recurring basis.

If a subscription line is assigned to a contract, almost all changes can be made in the contract. For example, an exception is that you can't change the quantity on subscription lines.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * If the **Next Billing Date** reaches the **Subscription Line End Date**, it isn't available. These subscription lines are considered ended and can no longer be billed.
> * An example of a service that should not be billed recurrently but store information about the sale is a warranty extension that's billed one time through the sales order. The information about how long the extension is valid is stored in the subscription lines.

## Editing subscription lines

### Log changes to subscription lines

You can edit subscription lines in subscriptions. To learn more, go to [Subscriptions](service-objects.md).

If any of the following fields are edited, the subscription line is archived before the change is made:

* Calculation Base Amount
* Calculation Base %
* Price
* Discount %
* Discount Amount
* Service Amount
* Billing Base Period
* Billing Rhythm

If the subscription amount changes due to quantity changes, the subscription line is also archived. In addition, changing the serial number will result in archiving, because the serial number is also present in the archived subscription lines.

If archived subscription lines exist, the **Archived Subscription Lines** checkbox on the subscription is selected. Choose **Yes** to display the archived subscription lines, including the corresponding quantity of the subscription. The timestamp and user who made the change can be viewed via the Page Inspector.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make several changes in quick succession to the same subscription line, only the original version is archived.

### Delete subscription lines

You can delete subscription lines if they aren't invoiced and aren't assigned to a contract. If they're assigned to a contract, the contract line can be deleted to remove the assignment. If the subscription lines are already invoiced, they must first be ended by choosing a date in the **Subscription Line End Date** field.

> [!NOTE]
> Contract lines and subscription lines are always identical. If you edit a contract line, the change automatically applies to the subscription lines.
