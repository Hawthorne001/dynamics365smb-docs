# Compliance with the Spanish regulations

In accordance with Spanish regulations—specifically Article 13 of Royal Decree 1007/2023 of December 5, which establishes the requirements for billing systems, and Article 15 of Ministerial Order HAC/1177/2024 of October 17, which defines the technical specifications for such systems—software providers are required to issue a self-responsible declaration confirming compliance with these obligations.  

In this article, you can find and download the self-responsible declarations issued by Microsoft for all supported versions of Business Central.
