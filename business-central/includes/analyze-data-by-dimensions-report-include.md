Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales or purchase orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. An example is to set up a dimension called Department, then use that dimension when you post sales documents. This way, you can use business intelligence tools to see which department sold which items.
