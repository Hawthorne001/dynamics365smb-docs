# Sustainabiltiy Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w2]()]


The Sustainability Power BI app provides a detailed insight into the emission usage of an organization allowing them to identify key areas to make changes. The app provides a variety of reports focusing on different key areas that organizations would want to keep track of such as [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md), [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) and [Social Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=37091) all to assist in Environment Social Governance (ESG) reporting.


## Sustainabiltiy analytics for the Sustainability team

To fit into this category you might have a role such as
- Sustainability Manager 
- Data Analyst

### Example scenario: The sustainability team need to review their Water and Waste Usage over a period

As someone on the Sustainability team, you want to consistently review your water and waste usage at specific facilities. Using the [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md) report, you will be able to review the capacity at each facility and location to see the available capacity should it be required in future.

The report also allows the team to track the different water and waste types along with the YOY and DOD change to ensure they are moving in the right direction.


## Sustainabiltiy analytics for the Executive team
To fit into this category you might have a role such as
- CEO
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Sustainability Officer

### Example scenario: Ensure targets are being met

For someone on the executive team, you need to ensure targets you put in place for the organization are being met. Using the  [Realized Emissions vs Target](sustainability-powerbi-realized-emissions-vs-target.md) you can quickly and efficiently compare your actual emissions with your target and make informed decisions and where to make changes where required.

This can be compared alongside the [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) to ensure your organization is on the right track moving forward.

For an executive looking for a quick high-level view for their organization, they can utilize the [Sustainability Overview](sustainability-powerbi-sustainability-overview.md)

## Alternative Use Cases

While the reports may provide the most benefit to the above, in some scenarios other roles can utilize this report pack. This can vary from a *Procurmenet Manager* using the [Emissions by Category and Scope](sustainability-powerbi-emissions-by-category-and-scope.md) to review Scope three so they can identify better vendors. Or a member of the *Human Resources* team can use the [Social Analaysis](sustainability-powerbi-social-analysis.md) report to get a view of Employee activties for an organization.
