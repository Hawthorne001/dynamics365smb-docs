This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, the feature uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, which is currently available for Business Central in some geographies. If your environment is located in a country/region where Azure OpenAI Service isn't available, administrators must allow data to move across geographies. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](/dynamics365/business-central/ai-copilot-data-movement).

The feature is validated and supported in English. While it can be used in other languages, it might not function as intended. Language quality might vary based on the user's interaction or system settings, which might impact accuracy and the user experience. The quality of answers can also be lower if the language setting for the user in Business Central differs from the primary language of the business data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] database. When Copilot searches the web, websites that aren't in English language may result in lower quality suggestions or no suggestions.

Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).
