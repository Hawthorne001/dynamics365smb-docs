# Vacation planning

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides a schedule of vacations for a calendar year:

1. Go to **Human Resources > Vacation Planning > Vacation Schedule**
1. To create a vacation schedule, create a new schedule by specifying in the **Year** field the calendar year for which the vacation schedule is drawn up. The **Description** field contains the name of the schedule.
1. To add all employees in the line of schedule use **Suggest Employees**.
1. The following fields must be filled in to form the main vacation schedule form:

   - Employee No.
   - Start date
   - End date

Field **Actual Start Date** is filled automatically when the orders to vacation are posted. If necessary, the field can be filled in manually.

The remaining fields of the form are filled in as needed in case of transfer of leave.
