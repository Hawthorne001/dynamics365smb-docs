title: Electronic Invoicing FAQ
summary: |
  Microsoft supports electronic invoicing in Business Central through the E-Document app, a standardized framework available across all localizations. In addition, users can install specific connectors to integrate with external e-invoicing exchange services. Country-specific requirements are delivered through dedicated E-Document localizations tailored for each supported market.   
  
  This FAQ answers some of the key questions about electronic invoicing.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > Tradeshift integration is no longer supported in Business Central and is planned for deprecation. Instead, try using the new E-Document functionality in Business Central https://aka.ms/bcedocuments.

  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: Do I need to use default connector?
        answer: No, Business Central supports various connectors, allowing users to choose the one that best fits their needs.
      - question: What are supported connectors?
        answer: The built-in support of PEPPOL uses APIs provided by Avalara, B2BRouter, Continia, Logiq, Pagero, and SignUp. New connections are planned for near future.
      - question: Which is last version of PEPPOL supported by Business Central?
        answer: The last version of PEPPOL supported by the default version of Business Central is **PEPPOL BIS 3.0**. But you can also find local versions in specific localizations.
      - question: Does Business Central support formats other than PEPPOL?
        answer: Yes, Business Central supports other formats based on specific local requirements, but they aren't part of W1.
      - question: How do I choose the connector to use?
        answer: You install and choose the connector from the **E-Document Services** page. Learn more in [Set up the E-Documents connector with external endpoints](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).
      - question: When I decide which connector I want to use it this usage already included into Business Central subscription?
        answer: Connectors are already technically enabled, so there's no need to develop them yourself. However, you must have a contract with the respective service provider. Using the service might incur extra costs.
      - question: Can I use different e-document formats if my customers have varying preferences for the required format?
        answer: Yes, you can. You’re able to assign a specific e-document format to each customer based on their preferences. However, you cannot use multiple formats simultaneously for the same customer. To support different formats, create separate E-Document Services, each configured with the desired format. Set up workflows for each service and link them to corresponding Document Sending Profiles. Finally, assign the appropriate Document Sending Profile to each customer. This setup ensures that each customer receives e-documents in their preferred format while maintaining consistency per customer.
      - question: Is there a log with all changes and communication with external services?
        answer: Yes, each e-document includes two types of logs; The Document Log, which records the creation and processing of both e-documents and standard documents in Business Central for auditing purposes across sales and purchase flows, and the Integration Log, which captures the communication between Business Central and external services — such as sending and receiving documents, status updates, and other integration-related activities.
