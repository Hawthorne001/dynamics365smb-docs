# Enter external document numbers

You can enter external document numbers for customers and vendors in all sales and purchase orders, invoices, and credit memos. You can use these numbers to search for posted sales and purchase lines later.  

> [!NOTE]
> Specify the document number that your customer or vendor has specified. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't check if these external document numbers are unique or duplicates.

The following procedure explains how to specify an external document number on a sales order, but similar steps apply to other sales and purchase documents.

## To enter external document numbers in a sales order  

1. [!INCLUDE[open-search](includes/open-search.md)], enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant sales order, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the invoice number.  

    On purchase documents, the relevant field is the **Vendor Invoice No.** field.
4. Fill in any other required fields.
