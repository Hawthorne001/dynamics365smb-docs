# Modern search in CZ applications

Giving users fast access to data is key. This feature adds to the Czech localization application a modern search option on lists that focuses exclusively on columns that are enhanced with full-text search capability, while retaining the option to use the older method. The modern search accelerates the search process and delivers more precise, relevant results, which increases user satisfaction and productivity.
