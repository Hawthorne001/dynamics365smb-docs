# Report selection for built-in finance reports

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides built-in Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, and Retained Earnings finance reports. The **Financial Reporting** feature defines the data and the layouts for these reports. You can replace the standard layouts that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides with your own.

## Built-in finance reports based on G/L account categories

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of your chart of accounts. With the use of G/L account categories, you can simplify your financial report definitions and make them more resilient to changes in the chart of accounts structure. The G/L account categories page also allows you to create financial report definitions for Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, and Retained Earnings.

Learn more at [Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements](bi-row-definitions.md#use-gl-account-categories-to-change-the-layout-of-your-financial-statements).

## Changing the foundation for the built-in finance reports

You can change the default financial reports used for the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, and Retained Earnings reports with your own report definitions. Go to the **General Ledger Setup** page and find the **Reporting** section.
