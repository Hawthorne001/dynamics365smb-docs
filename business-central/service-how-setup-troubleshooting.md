# Set up troubleshooting for service items

You can set up troubleshooting guidelines that help technicians solve problems when providing service. For example, guidelines might be a list of steps to perform a repair, or a series of questions to ask about the items. After you set up troubleshooting guidelines, you can assign them to service item groups, service items, and items. There's an inheritance hierarchy for guidelines. If you assign them to a service item group, the items included in the group inherits the guidelines unless you specify them for the items. Similarly, service items inherit guidelines from items.
