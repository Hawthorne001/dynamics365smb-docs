# Set up a loaner program

Sometimes you must provide a customer a loaner item for use when your customer service team makes a repair. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a loaner program, loan items to your customers, and track receipts when customers return the items. Additionally, you can add comments about loaners in one of two ways:  
  
* Enter a note or comment about the loaner itself.  
* Enter a note on a service item about the need for a loaner.  

## Set up a loaner

1. [!INCLUDE[open-search](includes/open-search.md)], enter **Loaners**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new loaner card.
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the loaner. Alternatively, if you have set up number series for loaners on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you can select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to enter the next available loaner number.  
4. Fill in the **Description**, **Description 2**, and **Serial No.** fields.  
5. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, choose the relevant unit of measure.
