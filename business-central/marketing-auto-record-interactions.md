# Record interactions with contacts automatically

You can set up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically record interactions for sales, purchase and service documents, cover sheets, e-mails, and phone calls. For example:

* Print sales or purchase quotes, orders, invoices, credit memos, cover sheets.
* Create sales service orders.
* Post sales service orders.
* Send e-mails to your contacts.
* Call your contacts, if you have a TAPI-compliant telephone and the correct installation.

To set up the automatic recording of these interactions, specify interaction templates for these documents and actions by using the **Interaction Template Setup** page.  

To open the **Interaction Template Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[open-search](includes/open-search-lowercase.md)], enter **Interaction Template Setup**, and then choose the related link.
