# Accounting for personal income tax payments

The Fund for the calculation and payment of personal income tax must be registered in the system as a supplier-tax authority.

Personal income tax calculations can be divided into three parts:

Calculation of the amount of personal income tax is carried out automatically at the time of the main payroll for each employee.
