# Create segments

You can create segments to select a group of contacts, for example, if you want to create an interaction involving several contacts, such as direct mail.

## Create a segment

1. [!INCLUDE[open-search](includes/open-search.md)], enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **General** section, in the **No.** field, enter a number for the segment.

    Alternatively, if you set up number series for segments on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to assign the next available segment number.
4. Fill in the other fields on the header.

You can now add contacts to the segment. Learn more at [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).
