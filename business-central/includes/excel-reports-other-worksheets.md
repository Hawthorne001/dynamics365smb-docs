The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] platform always adds three system worksheets to Excel reports:

- TranslationData, with text needed for multi-language reports.
- CaptionData, with text from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] fields needed for multi-language reports
- Aggregated Metadata, with data about the report, and when and how it was run.

All three worksheets are hidden by default. To learn more, go to [System Excel workbooks](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-excel-report-layout#system-excel-sheets) in the developer documentation.
