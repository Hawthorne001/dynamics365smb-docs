# Summarize records with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Use Copilot to get a quick summary of a record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, directly in the page's FactBox pane. The summary includes two or three concise bullet points that provide details and insights about the data. The summary helps you understand the data and identify areas that need attention. You can interact with the summary to link to data sources and open related pages, so you can act on your data.
